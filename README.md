# 1RMCalculator

##How to use
####Enter in the weight you used, followed by the reps you performed and hit calculate.

##Note:
####Repetitions above 12 reps are where things start to become inaccurate; for this reason, repetition values above 12 will throw an error.
####Also of note, deadlift maxes are tough to estimate based on reps performed at a submaximal weight; in my experience the calculations are thrown off if the reps exceed 5, give or take.
